   <strong>Breadbox</strong><br/> Build web applications with less tooling. No bundler required.
</p>

```bash
npm install --save-dev @sector/breadbox
```

1. Instead of bundling on every change, just run Breadbox **once** right after
   `npm install`.
2. Breadbox re-installs your dependencies as single JS files to a new
   `web_modules/` directory.
